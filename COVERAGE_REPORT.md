# Test Coverage Report (Session 5)

After generating and running your unit tests, use this file to document your code coverage results.

## How to Fill This Report
1. Build the project with coverage flags (e.g., `-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage` for gcc/g++).
2. Run your generated tests.
3. Use `gcov` or `lcov` to collect coverage data.
4. Summarize:
   - Total lines/functions covered
   - Percentage coverage
   - Any gaps or areas for improvement

---

## Example
- **Total Functions Covered:** 18/20 (90%)
- **Total Lines Covered:** 320/350 (91.4%)
- **Gaps:** Some error-handling branches not covered
- **Next Steps:** Add tests for edge cases in `controllers/` and `models/`
