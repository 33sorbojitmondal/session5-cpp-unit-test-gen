/*Thinking...
Alright, I need to generate a set of unit tests for the provided C++ file called test_main.cc. The user has given me some specific instructions on how to approach this.

First, I should understand what test_main.cc contains. From looking at the code, it's a test file that uses DROGON, which is a remote API client. There's a main function in there and another test class called BasicTest. The BasicTest seems to be where the unit tests will reside because the user provided an example for DROGON_TEST(BasicTest) but didn't add any tests.

The task is to generate comprehensive C++ unit tests using Google Test. I know that Google Test has its own test suite, test_gtest, which includes classes like Test, AutoBuilder, etc. Each function in the input file should have a corresponding test.

I need to cover all functions defined in test_main.cc. Let me list out the possible functions:

1. The class definition for DROGON_TEST(RemoteAPITest) and its method.
2. The test class BasicTest where some code is added, likely testing new functionality.

Since I'm focusing on unit tests, I'll focus on the BasicTest part. Let's think about what kind of tests are present there. It might have a test for adding data to an APITest object, checking responses, ensuring content type and status codes, etc.

I should also ensure that each test is unique and doesn't duplicate any existing ones. Using Test from Google Test would be appropriate since it allows me to name the tests easily.

Now, I'll plan out the unit tests:

1. **Test creating an APITest instance**: This should set up a request to the correct path.
2. **Check content type and status code**: After sending a request, verify that the response includes these headers correctly.
3. **Add some test data**: Add the required test data before making a request.
4. **Send the request**: Use the sendRequest method on the client.
5. **Verify the HTTP result**: Check if the request was successful, status is 200 OK, and content type is correct.

I'll write each of these as separate tests using the Test class from Google Test. Each test will be wrapped with @Test to ensure they are part of a test suite.

For the code coverage, I need to include all necessary headers. The test file should include DROGON/drogon_test.h and DROGON/drogon.h as usual. Also, using a test_gtest instance might be beneficial for easier integration with Google Test's assertions.

I should make sure that each test is properly indented and follows C++ best practices, including semicolons at the end of statements. Each function in the main file (like app().getLoop()) will be encapsulated within a unit test class.

Finally, I'll name each test appropriately to reflect what they're testing, like Test_ApiTestCreateRequest, etc., so it's clear which part of the code is being tested.

I should also ensure that all necessary includes are present. The test file must include the header files where DROGON's API is defined. Additionally, using the test_gtest object will provide a reliable way to write and run tests according to Google Test conventions.
...done thinking.

```cpp*/
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <drogon/drogon_test.h>
#include <drogon/drogon.h>

using namespace std;

class Test_ApiTest : public :: Test {
    @override
    auto GetRequest() -> Promise<void> {
        return promise;
    }
};

TEST(ApiTest, BasicTest) {
    Test_ApiTest::GetRequest p1;
    
    auto client = p1.getClient();
    
    expect(client->sendRequest(new HttpRequest(), [test](auto res, const HttpRequest& hp) {
        // There's nothing we can do if the request didn't reach the server
        // or the server generated garbage.
        REQUIRE(res == drogon::ReqResult::Ok);
        
        REQUIRE(hp != nullptr);

        CHECK(hp->getStatusCode() == k200OK);
        CHECK(hp->contentType() == CT_APPLICATION_JSON);
    });
    
    @Test::Fact(1)
    {
        auto request = new HttpRequest();
        expect(app().getLoop()->queueInLoop([&p](auto& p) { p.set_value(); }), request);
        
        test::fact(2)
            expects(app().getLoop()).queueInLoop([]() { app().quit(); })
                    .queueInLoop([&p1]() { p1.set_value(); });
    }
}
