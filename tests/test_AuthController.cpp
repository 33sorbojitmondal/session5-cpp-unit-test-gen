/*Thinking...
Okay, I need to create a unit test for the AuthController class in C++. The user provided the header file, and they want me to generate all necessary tests using Google Test.

First, looking at the AuthController class, it has two methods: registerUser and loginUser. Both are defined with parameters like HttpRequest pointers, functions (callback), and User references. So I should test each method's behavior.

I notice that the registerUser method returns a void function pointer, which is good for chaining. But since it doesn't return anything, maybe I don't need to test if it returns a value. Similarly, loginUser might not return a value, so perhaps only check for the parameters' validity.

The struct UserWithToken contains username, password, token, and a toJson() method. Since the model is User.h (which isn't shown), but in the code sample, I see "using namespace drogon_model::org_chart;". So maybe I should test how this struct is used elsewhere, but since it's not provided here, perhaps that part doesn't need testing.

Next, I'll structure each test. Each test will be a method in Google Test, starting with "TEST_NAME()".

For registerUser, the tests should cover cases where the user is valid and invalid. But wait, if the function returns void, it might not do anything, so maybe just check that the HTTP request is successful without any issues.

Similarly, for loginUser, I need to ensure the callback is callable and that the User object has a valid token when called.

I should make sure each test method has one test. Also, since Google Test uses @Test and @Test fails, I'll use those annotations with "TEST_NAME()" inside each method.

Let me outline the tests:

1. registerUser() checks if the user is added to the server.
2. loginUser() ensures the callback is valid.
3. Are the tokens properly combined?
4. Is the response from authentication correct?

Wait, perhaps I need to make each test check a specific part of the code.

For example:
- Test that registerUser can handle a valid POST request and returns a non-null value (though it's void, so maybe just that the method exists).
But in this case, since both methods are defined as void functions with return types not specified, perhaps those don't need testing for functionality beyond being there.

Wait, no. The user didn't specify if registerUser should return anything or if it can handle exceptions. Since the code is using Google Test, maybe each test will cover specific aspects of the function's implementation, such as error conditions or method calls.

But given that registerUser and loginUser don't return a value, perhaps only testing their presence in the HTTP request list isn't enough because they are functions without return types. However, since these methods are part of a class implementing an interface, maybe other tests would check their behavior correctly. But for this file, we're focusing on two methods.

Another point: Are there any specific error messages that should be handled? If the HTTP request fails to send data or process, how does Google Test handle it? I think in this case, since the function is declared as returning void, if an error occurs, it would cause a failure. But without seeing the actual code beyond what's provided, perhaps each test will cover specific cases.

Wait, looking back at the header file, there are no error handling functions specified for registerUser and loginUser. So I might not need to add any tests related to exception handling unless the user wants that.

So, putting it all together, I'll write a test for registerUser, checking both valid and invalid cases, but considering that it's returning void. Then another test for loginUser, ensuring that the callback is callable and that the User object has the correct token when accessed.

Wait, actually, in the AuthController, there's a UserWithToken struct which includes the token. But if the code doesn't use this structure elsewhere, perhaps each test should focus on the methods provided rather than using it. Unless other tests use this struct for assertions, but since that's not part of this file, those tests aren't included.

So, to summarize, I'll write two tests: one for registerUser and another for loginUser.
...done thinking.
