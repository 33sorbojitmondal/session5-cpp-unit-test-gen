Thinking...
Okay, I need to create unit tests for the LoginFilter class in the provided .cpp file using Google Test. Let me start by understanding what each part of the code does.

The .cpp file includes a header file with some #includes and uses statements. The class is a subclass of HttpFilter<LoginFilter>, which suggests it's a filter that works like an HTTP endpoint.

Looking at the provided code, there are no explicit test cases or functions to test. So I need to come up with tests for all possible functionality of LoginFilter. But how?

First, I should check if LoginFilter is part of the standard library. Wait, in C++, when a class inherits from another class that includes its own headers, you have to use 'using' directives. But without seeing the definition of HttpFilter or LoginFilter, it's hard to say whether they're present.

Wait, looking at the .cpp file again: It has an abstract class HttpFilter<LoginFilter> but doesn't include any implementations, which suggests that perhaps the user forgot to add them. Oh, maybe I should assume that HttpFilter is in the standard headers and that LoginFilter uses them correctly. But for testing purposes, I can proceed without their contents.

The tests need to cover all functionality of the LoginFilter class. Let's list what each member does:

1. The constructor: initializes a flag 'isbidden' as true.
2. The doFilter method: checks if the request is allowed based on the value of 'isbidden'.
3. The createRequest method: creates a HttpRequest object with different parameters.

I should test these three methods to ensure that when 'isbidden' is false, requests are processed normally, and when it's true, certain validations are skipped.

So for each function, I'll write unit tests using Google Test. Each test will mock the function, provide some input data, and check if the output behaves as expected.

I need to make sure that the tests cover all possible valid inputs without relying on external libraries or classes beyond what's provided.

Let me outline each test:

1. Test doFilter with isbidden = false: The value should be 0.
2. Test createRequest with invalid parameters (invalid length) and expect 0.
3. Test createRequest with invalid character in the name, expecting 0.
4. Test getParameterNames and check parameter names are set correctly when valid.

I'll write each test using a mock for doFilter, passing dummy data when needed, and assert the result is correct.

Additionally, I need to include necessary headers. Since HttpFilter isn't present, but perhaps it's in <httpfilter.h>, which doesn't need including, so no need there. LoginFilter's implementation would be elsewhere, so if not included, maybe use using statements or assume they're correctly imported.

Wait, the code provided has #include <drogon/HttpFilter.h>, so that should be okay. The tests don't need to include more headers beyond what's necessary for Google Test and any other required includes.

I think I have a clear plan now. Write three separate test files if needed, each testing one of the main functions with appropriate mocks and inputs.
...done thinking.

    requests.push_back(new Request());

    request = &requests[0];
    mockRequest->request(request).done();
    
    AutoPtr<Request> expected(2);
    expect(request == (const auto&)[0]->data().append("test")).then->equals("test").then->add("invalid_length", -1)
        .then->done();
