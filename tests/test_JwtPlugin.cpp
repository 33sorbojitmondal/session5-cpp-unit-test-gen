/*Thinking...
Okay, so I need to create unit tests for the provided C++ file called JwtPlugin.cc. The user specified that each function in the input should be covered by at least one test and that all necessary includes must be added. Also, the output should be a file named test_<input_filename>.cpp.

First, looking at the given file, I see several functions: initAndStart, init, and shutdown. Each of these is part of the JwtPlugin class. The init function initializes some variables using the config, while init returns an instance of the Jwt. Shutdown just logs messages. 

I should create unit tests for each of these functions. Let me go through them one by one.

Starting with initAndStart. This function takes a Json::Value and does some initialization. To test this, I can pass in dummy values so that when we call config, it returns specific objects. For example, if the secret is "secret", I can create a string literal. Similarly, for sessionTime, using 3600 as an int. Issuer would be a string. Then, calling initAndStart with these should return the instance. But since this function doesn't do anything else, maybe it's just about ensuring that it initializes correctly when called. So I'll test it by passing in some dummy data and checking if the returned object is initialized properly.

Next is the init function. It takes a config value as a parameter and returns a Jwt. To test this function, I should ensure it can take any of the possible values specified in the config and return the correct instance. So perhaps I'll test by calling init with "secret", "sessionTime", and "issuer" respectively. If these are handled correctly, then the tests pass.

Lastly, the shutdown function logs messages. Since this is a utility, testing it would involve just verifying that logging does what it's supposed to do when called. But since it's an error handler and not something we control, maybe I can test if calling shutdown without arguments doesn't throw exceptions or log errors as expected. Alternatively, perhaps the tests don't need to cover this as much because it's not part of the API.

Wait, but the user said not to create duplicate tests. So each function should have its own test that isn't identical to others. Also, I should include all necessary #include statements at the beginning. Looking back, the file includes "JwtPlugin.h" and "drogon.h". Since these are already present, no need to add anything else.

Each test function will be a lambda or a separate function in the unit tests namespace. The functions should return the actual object being tested (like the returned Jwt instance) so that I can assert its behavior.

So for initAndStart, perhaps pass in dummy values and check if it returns an initialized instance correctly. For init, use different config keys to ensure each is handled properly. And for shutdown, just call it without arguments and verify logging as expected.

I should structure each test function with appropriate assertions. For example, when testing initAndStart, after calling the function, I can assert that the returned object has the correct private members initialized correctly. Or perhaps check if certain variables are set in the config, but since config is passed in, maybe that's not necessary unless required by specific tests.

Wait, looking again at the file, the only parameters for initAndStart might be Json::Value, which could include any possible configuration. So to test its functionality correctly, I should pass in some dummy values and ensure that the returned object behaves as expected when used elsewhere in the code.

I think that's about it. Now, structuring this into test files, each function becomes a test in a new unit tests file with an appropriate namespace.
...done thinking.

Here are the comprehensive unit tests for the provided C++ file:

```cpp*/
#include "JwtPlugin.h"
#include "drogon.h"

using namespace drogon;

#include <TestAssert>

void testInitAndStart() {
    const Json::Value dummy = { {"secret"}, {"2014-09-15 00:00:00.000", "3600"}, {"auth0"} };
    auto result = initAndStart(dummy);
    
    TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL(result); // Ensure object is not null
    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL("secret", (const char*)result->secret.c_str()); // Compare secret string
    
    TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL(result->sessionTime);
    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL(3600, result->sessionTime); // Compare int values
    TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL(result->issuer);
    
    TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL(result->log("some log")); // Verify logging
}

void testInit() {
    const Json::Value dummy = { "secret", 45 };
    auto result = init(dummy);
    
    TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL(result); // Ensure object is not null
    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL("secret", (const char*)result->secret.c_str()); // Compare secret string
    
    TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL(result->sessionTime);
    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL(3600, result->sessionTime); // Compare int values
    TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL(result->issuer);
    
    TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL(result->log("some log")); // Verify logging
}

void testShutdown() {
    const char *msg = "JWT shutdown called";
    init();
    init().shutdown();
    
    TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL(init().getStack()[0]); // Verify stack frame
    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL(msg, init().getStack()[1]); // Verify message
}
```

Note: The unit tests are provided in the `drogon` namespace. They test the behavior of each function within the ` JwtPlugin` class.
